          <h1 class=>Nairobi is decaying, choking and mired in shopping malls</h1>
          <p class="un">Having resided in Eastlands for most of my life in Nairobi, it still feels like home every time I drive through the estates.
          <div class=/"column">
The more affluent areas of Nairobi like Karen, Lavington and Muthaiga were my tourist destinations, where I visited once in a while to attend church or travel to what we referred to as arcades or shopping centres.

I was attracted to the beauty of their architectural designs.  The St. Austin’s Church at St. Mary’s School was baronial to me. It has powerful messages on the inside and outside, and it will be centuries before we make such a powerful statement in architecture again.

Karen Shopping Centre, though small, had some character.  Today it stands bewildered in a morass of urban architectural abuse.

It is usually built far away from a city and a town center which means people must go on their cars ,resulting an increased air pollution. ...........</p>
